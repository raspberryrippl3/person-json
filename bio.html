I'm <strong>Oliver Partridge</strong>, a web developer at <a href="https://oi-digital.co.uk" target="_blank" data-hit="10361">OI Digital</a>. My journey in developing websites began during the height of the dot-com bubble circa 2000, working for a magazine publisher building websites to drive online subscriptions. That's 24 years in the business and I truly have seen it all - the good, the bad, and the ugly. A lot has changed in the way websites get built and developed in those 24 years and I take the time to make sure I am up-to-speed with current website build methods, web technologies and web design trends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">I love my job. I have worked for a diverse range of clients, from the <strong>NHS</strong>, the <strong>RSPCA</strong>, to your local builder or plumber. But it's not only that, I love my clients and have built relationships out of them. Quite often I can be found cycling through the Chilterns with a Product Strategist!</span></p>

<p><cite><span style="font-size:16px">"Wow! <strong>Oliver Partridge</strong> really knows what his doing and has literally fixed my entire online business.
